            SESP second-year Max Byrne gazed out of the conference room window, 
            watching people pass by. It was 40 minutes into Reform CAPS’ weekly 
            meeting with Northwestern Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). 
            Once the clock hit the 45-minute mark, Byrne knew what they had to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We don’t feel like meeting with you guys going forward is productive,” 
            Byrne told University administration. “We hope you guys continue to 
            do the work that we have started here, and to listen to these student 
            experiences that we’ve shared and in your own way – do what you think 
            you can and should.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Byrne stood up, pushed in their chair and walked out of the room. 
            SESP second-year and Reform CAPS co-founder Genni Bogdanowicz 
            followed, while Medill second-year Maddie Southwell gathered the 
            stacks of printed student testimonies scattered across the table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reform CAPS co-founder Sahibzada Mayed, a McCormick and Communication third-year, 
            was the last to leave. He looked at the other Reform CAPS members as they headed 
            toward the door, avoiding eye contact with the three administrators in the room. 
            It was officially over.
          </p>

            On March 7, 2022, the <a class = "byline-link" href = "https://northbynorthwestern.com/reformcaps-students-rally-for-better-mental-health-services/" target = "_blank">mental health advocacy group</a> terminated its working 
            relationship with CAPS Executive Director Garrett Gilmer, CAPS Clinical 
            Director Shenay Bridges-Carter and Dean of Students Mona Dugo following 
            a breakdown in communication after comments made by Reform CAPS members 
            in a <a class = "byline-link" href = "https://dailynorthwestern.com/2022/02/04/in-focus/in-focus-northwestern-students-call-for-overhaul-of-campus-mental-health-services-amid-national-wave-of-collegiate-advocacy/" target = "_blank">Daily Northwestern article.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            After six months of meetings, University officials and Reform CAPS 
            clashed on whether CAPS should acknowledge students it has harmed 
            and held conflicting perspectives on procedural changes in mental 
            health services.
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand why Reform CAPS decided to end its relationship with 
            University administration, North by Northwestern has examined the 
            timeline of events that led to the walkout.

            It started at 8:30 a.m. on a Monday. Members of Reform CAPS 
            walked through the basement of Scott Hall to their first meeting 
            with senior CAPS officials in a conference room near Dugo’s office. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In one hand, Bogdanowicz carried a Peets coffee cup. In the other, 
            she carried eight hours worth of research compiled into a zine 
            that would drive the conversation. It contained everything from 
            CAPS’ referral database demographics to descriptions of student 
            experiences from the <a class = "byline-link" href = "https://www.instagram.com/reformcapsnu/" target = "_blank">Reform CAPS Instagram page.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Across the conference table from the students were Gilmer, 
            Bridges-Carter and Dugo.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think that it’s hard to have a trusting relationship with 
            administration when you are coming from two very different positions,” 
            Bogdanowicz told NBN in an exclusive interview after the end of 
            Reform CAPS’ relationship with University officials. 
          </p>
          <p>
            “They have a lot of institutional power, and we’ve been harmed 
            by the institutions they have power in,” she added.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reform CAPS initiated conversations with CAPS to share student 
            experiences and drive changes in mental health services on 
            campus, Bogdanowicz and Mayed said. The group also wanted 
            CAPS to be more transparent with the student body.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We had a lot of conversations about misunderstandings about our 
            processes, and then when [Bridges-Carter] and I would talk 
            through how certain things happened, that seemed to be 
            relieving to them or reassuring to them,” Gilmer told NBN. 
            “But [Reform CAPS’] feedback to us is, ‘That’s not known to 
            the student body. We don’t know that. Can you put that out 
            there publicly for us?’”
          </p>
          <p>
            During its meetings with CAPS, Reform CAPS brought up several issues, 
            including the University’s use of police in crisis responses, 
            high rates of student hospitalization and CAPS’ FAQ page.
          </p>

            In mid November, after weekly Monday meetings with administration, 
            Reform CAPS sat down with the Daily Northwestern to talk about 
            CAPS and mental health at NU. 
          </p>
          <p>
            By Feb. 4, 2022, when the Daily published the article, both sides 
            of the conference room table were beginning to question how 
            aligned they really were.

          <p>
            When Dugo read the Daily article, she was met with criticism 
            from students who had terrible experiences with CAPS. Some 
            came from the Reform CAPS members she had been meeting with for months. 
          </p>
      
         <p>
          The importance of student experiences and feedback was part of the 
          reason why Dugo, Gilmer and Bridges-Carter said they wanted to meet 
          with Reform CAPS. They hoped that learning directly from students 
          about what CAPS could do better would facilitate positive changes.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We spent a lot of time in the first meeting and in subsequent 
          meetings listening to student accounts. I followed their 
          Instagram page, I continue to follow it,” Dugo said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Dugo was surprised to see these criticisms raised without 
          acknowledging the procedural reforms that administrators 
          said occurred after five months of meetings.
         </p>
         <p>
          When Gilmer arrived at Northwestern in 2020, he said the waitlist 
          for students seeking therapy had more than 50 names. Today, 
          Gilmer said there are only eight or nine. Mental health hospitalization 
          rates and the use of police during crisis situations have also been 
          reduced, he said.
         </p>        
         <p>
          These reforms have also not been cut and dry, according to Bridges-Carter. 
          There are still many changes that CAPS’ senior administrators said 
          they want to see. But amid struggles with staff retention and 
          increased workloads for CAPS counselors, Bridges-Carter said CAPS’ 
          priority must be the immediate care of the student body.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I think that there’s a lot of things that get in the way of us 
          making the type of headway on some of these projects that we’d 
          like to make,” Bridges-Carter said. CAPS is also understaffed, 
          with the <a class = "byline-link" href = "https://www.northwestern.edu/counseling/about/meet-the-staff.html" target = "_blank">service’s website</a> listing only 24 staff members for the 
          Evanston campus.
         </p>
         <p>
          The administrators’ biggest fear was that the article could have a 
          chilling effect that would prevent students from seeking help 
          through CAPS, Gilmer said.
         </p>
         <p>
          That week, the administrators rescheduled their meeting with Reform CAPS. 
          They planned instead to reconvene the week of Feb. 21 to discuss 
          the contents of the Daily article.

          <p>
            Reform CAPS had no intention of severing their ties with administration – 
            until this meeting about the Daily article.
          </p>
         <p>
          “The major concern that was brought up that I felt from their side 
          is that they were seeing this Daily article as us attacking them,” 
          Mayed said. “They were on a defensive mode, where they felt that 
          this was a breach of our trust and our relationship together.”
         </p>
          <p>
            To Mayed and Bogdanowicz, the concerns CAPS raised felt more like a 
            PR problem that administrators needed to contain.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            “There was this portion where they would treat us almost like a 
            propaganda group,” Mayed said. “They saw us as spreading ‘negative’ 
            experiences about CAPS, and that framing of positive and negative 
            is really harmful because these are actual student experiences.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bogdanowicz’s frustration grew more potent as the meeting continued. 
            It had been eight months since she co-founded Reform CAPS and 
            four months since the group began meeting with administrators. 
            Now, she felt that she was being talked down to and chastised.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think the main one was really framing the Daily article and all of 
            our work as specifically targeting CAPS’s reputation and ruining that 
            reputation,” Bogdanowicz said. “Somehow that we were the ones 
            harming students, which felt … invalidating of the work that we had been doing.”

            <i>Rage.</i> That was what Mayed felt sitting at the conference table 
            and listening to the administrators. 
          </p>
          <p>
            “There are three stories that are publicly shared in that article 
            very in-depth, and in our 90-minute meeting, none of those stories 
            were explicitly mentioned by any of the administrators in the 
            context of acknowledgement,” he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of those stories was Mayed’s – his involuntary commitment 
            order at the hands of CAPS.
          </p>
          <p>
            “All of the administrators that day, none of them had the decency 
            to bring that up even once in that meeting,” Mayed said. “We 
            actually have the folks who have the institutional power and 
            who inherited those systems sitting in front of [us], and they 
            are just going to blab on about how some of their new systems 
            aren’t being accurately represented.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Daily article was not the first time Dugo had heard Mayed’s story. 
            They had shared it with her four months prior, during their first 
            meeting. Dugo said she felt she had acknowledged the importance of
            Mayed’s story and that CAPS needed to do better.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I really regret that that’s the takeaway, in whatever way that 
            I contributed to that feeling I regret that because that’s not 
            how I feel,” said Dugo. “I feel concerned that that was their 
            experience, and I think we’ve really worked to try to change things.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Reform CAPS members told the administrators that their interview 
            with the Daily occurred shortly after their meetings began. Gilmer 
            said he was more relieved to hear that the Daily article did not 
            reflect Reform CAPS members’ current outlook about mental health 
            services on campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except, according to Mayed, it did. Mayed told NBN their statements 
            in November “accurately represented” what Reform CAPS stands for.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the distance grew between the priorities of Northwestern’s 
            administration and Reform CAPS, members knew they never wanted 
            to have a meeting like that ever again.

            Reform CAPS canceled the Feb. 28 meeting with CAPS. Instead, the 
            group met to consider if having these discussions was a productive 
            use of its members’ time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meeting with Northwestern administration was not an opportunity 
            afforded to many student activist groups on campus, Byrne said, 
            so ending meetings with CAPS couldn’t be because of  “reactionary rage.” 
            It needed to be the right decision for the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the members realized the changes they had hoped to enact within 
            CAPS weren’t happening on the timeline they had expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the group’s major goals is transparency, and it worked to 
            update <a class = "byline-link" href = "https://www.northwestern.edu/counseling/about/faqs.html" target = "_blank">CAPS’ FAQ page</a> so information would be more accessible to 
            students. But changing the FAQ page was one of the only tangible 
            things that Mayed saw come out of these meetings.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It really took five months to update FAQs,” Mayed said. 
            “We understand some of the constraints that they may have, 
            but from our perspective that felt like, ‘Is this all we achieved 
            in five months?’” 
          </p>
          <p>
            Members believed the meetings had become more of a back and 
            forth of CAPS sharing some information and Reform CAPS 
            sharing student experiences, but to little end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group met with Stefanie Lyn Kaufman-Mthimkhulu, the founder 
            of a national mental health advocacy organization called <a class = "byline-link" href = "https://projectlets.org/" target = "_blank">Project Lets,</a> 
            and asked if ending meetings with CAPS meant that they were giving 
            up on the students.
          </p>
          <p>
            “They made it really clear that this was not giving up,” 
            Bogdanowicz said. “This means that this is not the right 
            path for right now.”

            It ended at 9:15 a.m. on a Monday. Members of Reform CAPS 
            walked through the basement of Scott Hall for their last 
            meeting with senior CAPS officials. 
          </p>
       
          <p>
            “For this meeting, it absolutely felt like we were back to 
            our very first meeting with CAPS because we had fully written out 
            scripts and points we wanted to touch on, which was not the 
            norm,” Mayed said.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            They walked in with a stack of papers, shuffling them around 
            on purpose so that the administrators knew they had an agenda.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            After a couple minutes of dead air passed, the Reform CAPS members 
            began to read student experiences again, like they had during 
            the first meeting. They retold their own experiences. They 
            responded to some of the criticisms that administrators made 
            toward Reform CAPS in the previous meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            For 35 minutes, they talked and the administrators listened. 
            In the remaining moments, the meeting quickly went south.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Personally, I shared my own experience and it was invalidated,” 
            Bogdanowicz said. “The way that they framed not just my 
            experience but also the other student experiences was, 
            ‘We’re adults. We know things that you don’t know.’”
          </p>
          <p>
            After Bogdanowicz shared her story involving police intervention 
            during a crisis, one of the administrators said they knew about her 
            situation and that they had a different perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was literally like a slap in the face. It was going past invalidation,” 
            Bogdanowicz said. “It felt like they were telling me what my experience 
            was, and at that point I literally wanted to get up and walk out.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Byrne shared the story of how they were uncomfortable reaching out 
            to CAPS when a friend was having a psychotic episode. In response, 
            Byrne said one of the administrators implied that delaying treatment 
            could have caused their friend permanent damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            “When I heard that, it was like an electric shock,” Byrne said. 
            “That was when I knew. I realized the full depth of how useless 
            it was and how it wasn’t productive for us, for the other students, 
            and how it was also so taxing on me and us, putting all this work 
            in to see this constant invalidation of our personal experiences 
            and the student body as a whole.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Legally, University officials have to protect student privacy by 
            maintaining confidentiality around student experiences, so 
            Gilmer said he could not fully comment on the cases the 
            Reform CAPS members were discussing at their meetings with CAPS.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think that may have contributed to the lack of acknowledgement that 
            [the Reform CAPS members] were looking for about what they had shared, 
            being in that quandary, trying to manage that ethical responsibility of 
            keeping confidentiality,” Gilmer said.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Reform CAPS members shared their experiences with CAPS, 
            Bridges-Carter said she felt she couldn’t fully voice her administrative 
            perspective of what policies and procedures are important in different 
            crisis situations because of the meeting’s structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My comparison is like, I’m being poked at, but my hands are tied behind my 
            back. I can’t respond. I can’t protect myself. I just have to try and put 
            my body in a position such that it doesn’t hurt me when I’m being poked 
            at,” Bridges-Carter said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Toward the end of the meeting, administrators apologized to Mayed 
            for his experience with CAPS after he asked about accountability. 
          </p>
          <p>
            “I understand there is a difference between intention and impact, and 
            they took our responses as [if] we didn’t care about their experiences, 
            or we weren’t validating their experiences,” Dugo told NBN. “We did 
            take time in that meeting to validate their stories. I think maybe 
            I didn’t do it soon enough in the meeting, but I did hear it. I think 
            we all heard.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But by the time administrators shared their apologies and validations, 
            Mayed and other members of the group wanted to utter their final goodbyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even the apology, to me personally, was framed in this way of, 
            ‘I’m so sorry if you’ve felt that we’ve not acknowledged this. 
            We acknowledged this experience when we first started meeting,’” 
            Mayed said. “They just felt like it’s a one-time thing, but centering 
            student experiences means that [they have] to be centered in every 
            single conversation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayed said the apology was hollow and meant little to him. He wondered 
            if other students who weren’t able to meet with CAPS face-to-face would 
            ever receive an apology. 
          </p>
          <p>
            But acknowledgement of harm is not in the cards for CAPS. There 
            are a lot of students who have painful stories about CAPS, but 
            according to Gilmer and Dugo, there are also a lot of students 
            who have had great experiences with CAPS. 
          </p>
          <p>
            “I fundamentally disagree with a public apology around the services 
            that CAPS has offered because there was a lot of good done in those 
            years, and I know we have to make shifts,” Dugo told NBN.
          </p>
          <p>
            The administrators in the meeting believed that once they were done 
            listening to these student experiences, there would be room for 
            dialogue. But once Byrne announced Reform CAPS no longer wanted to 
            meet, it was clear that wasn’t the case.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There are a lot of students that have been harmed in the past. 
            That’s the foundation of our work,” Bogdanowicz said. “Their 
            inability or unwillingness to acknowledge those experiences means 
            that those students who have had those experiences in the past are 
            still being, in a way, shut out from those resources.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As Reform CAPS walked out, the room was silent again. The student 
            group didn’t expect a response, nor did its members want one. 
          </p>

            Today, Reform CAPS is returning to its original goals and updating 
            its list of demands for CAPS. The group is forming a statement of 
            acknowledgement of student experiences that it had asked CAPS to 
            release. It’s also working to expand the campus chapter of Project 
            Lets to bring more student-led mental health services to NU.
          </p>
          <p>
            But on that final night during their post-meeting debrief, 
            Byrne showed up with what they thought was an ugly and profane 
            sheet cake. (Reform CAPS asked North by Northwestern not to 
            print exactly what the sheet cake said.) The group sat in Main 
            Library and had their cake, choosing to view the end of these meetings 
            as a chance to do something new and potentially better.
          </p>
          <p>
            “These meetings have been very heavy and a lot of the work that we’ve 
            been doing is very heavy, so we’re trying to find the joy in it and 
            the good moments,” Bogdanowicz said. “Not to make light of the 
            experiences or situation, but I think that’s something you have 
            to do in advocacy work. Find the joy in it.”
